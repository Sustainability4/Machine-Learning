Ensemble Techniques is a method in which we aggregate various models to obtain the final output or prediction. They involve two primary techniques Bagging
and boosting. Bagging contains the most important algorithm called Random Forest and boosting contains three very important algorithms titled xg boost, 
gradient boost and adaptive boosting. We will discuss four things in here: 

1. Decision Tree Algorithm : Indepth intuition, hand proof, code implementation (Regressor and Classifier)
2. Bagging Techniques : Indepth intuition
    1. Random Forest Technique : Regressor and Classifier Indepth intuition, hand proof, code implementation
3. Boosting Techniques : Indepth Intuition 
    1. Adaptive Boosting : Regressor and Classifier Indepth intuition, hand proof, code implementation
    2. Gradient Boosting : Regressor and Classifier Indepth intuition, hand proof, code implementation
    3. Xg Boost: Regressor and Classifier Indepth intuition, hand proof, code implementation
